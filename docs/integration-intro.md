The objective of Codiga is to offer a platform that should be easily integrated into your workflow.
As developers are using multiple tools, we have two objectives:

1.  **Frictionless integration**: integrate with the most popular tools so that developers can be productive on day one.
2.  **Expose data through our API**: if developers do not have all the necessary integrations, expose all data through an [API](api.md) so that they can build what they need.

The following sections details the first objective and details all existing integration of Codiga
with other platforms. The API is detailed in [a separate page](api.md).
