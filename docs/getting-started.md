Codiga is a code analysis platform that helps developers produce better code
and address technical debt. The platform provides the following functions:

- **Code Analysis with historical analysis**: analyze each code change and keep analysis history so that you can monitor trends in your codebase.
- **Technical Debt Analysis**: estimate the financial cost of your technical debt and prioritize its fix.
- **Automated Code Reviews**: automatically surface code smells, duplicates or complex functions when sending code for review.
- **Integration with multiple platforms**: Codiga is integrated with GitHub, Gitlab, Bitbucket, Jenkins, Travis-CI and Slack.

Codiga is an open platform and you can develop your own tool on top of its analysis engine.
All data is exposed on a GraphQL API that lets you access all analysis data.
